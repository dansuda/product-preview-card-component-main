## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS/SCSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Mobile First Approach

### What I learned

This was a breath of fresh air in terms of difficulty compared to all the other ones, but it's probably because of the consistent practice I've been putting towards learning HTML and CSS to the best of my ability.

Something new I learnt was the double ```display: flex``` was a thing and that it could be used to align the items in the flex parent side by side.

I also got through this whole project without referencing anyone else's work or YouTube video, so I'm proud of that.


### Continued development

I think I'd have to do more and more projects until I'm confident in my abilities on the basics so I can now go into javascript.


### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to understand how to use various css rules and how important they are. 
- (https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing website which has really old questions but are still relevant to people like me today who seem to have joined this bandwagon very late. It's nice and helpful they've been around for so long.
